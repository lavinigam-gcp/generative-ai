# Cloud Run application with Web UI that demonstrates working with Vertex AI API

This application demonstrates a Cloud Run application that has a simple Form-based UI that represents a Chat widget. You can put in your query and it will invoke the PaLM Chat Bison model in the background and get back the response. It is a simple example but something that you can look to embed into your larger web application.

## Build and Deploy the application to Cloud Run

To deploy the Flask Application in [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/deploy-container), you need to build the Docker image in Artifact Registry and deploy it in Cloud Run.

First step is to add your Google Project ID in the `app.py` file.

Next, look at the following script, replace the variables at the start and run the commands one after the other. This assumes that you have `gcloud` setup on your machine.

```sh
PROJECT_ID=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
REGION=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GCP_REGION_NAME>
AR_REPO=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AR_REPO_NAME>
SERVICE_NAME=chat-flask-app
gcloud artifacts repositories create $AR_REPO --location=$REGION --repository-format=Docker
gcloud auth configure-docker $REGION-docker.pkg.dev
gcloud builds submit --tag $REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME
gcloud run deploy $SERVICE_NAME --port 8080 --image $REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME --allow-unauthenticated --region=$REGION --platform=managed  --project=$PROJECT_ID
```

Alternately, if you are in VS Code using the Cloud Code Extension, you can deploy the application directly to Cloud Run by:

1. Click on Cloud Code extension in the bar at the bottom.
2. Select Deploy to Cloud Run.
3. Go ahead with the defaults. Modify them accordingly if you'd like.
4. Click on Deploy.

This will take a few minutes and the result will be the Cloud Run Service URL that you can use directly in the web browser to access the application.
