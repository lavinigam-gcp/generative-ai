# Sample Apps built with various different tools utilising Vertex PaLM API

Sample Applications have been provided that you can deploy on Google Cloud. 


The applications demonstrate how you can use standard frameworks like Python Flask, Streamlit, Gradio to host applications on Google Cloud that interact with the Vertex AI PaLM Models : Text , Chat and Code. 

These code samples are provided as templates that you can use. You can go through the various projects and pick a project or two that interests you. Click on any of the projects to see detailed documentation, sample template and instructions to deploy on Google Cloud.
